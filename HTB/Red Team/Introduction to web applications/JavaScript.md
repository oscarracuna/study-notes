JS is one of the most used languages in the world. Used for web and mobile development.

JS code is loaded with the " <script></script> " tag

You can also load remote JS with the src and link of the script

<script src=" ./script.js"></script>

Example:

```javascript
document.getElementById("button1").innerHTML = "Changed Text!";
```

- JS is also used to automate complex processes and perform HTTP requests to interact with the back end components and send and retrieve data.
- It's also used alongside CSS to drive advanced animations that would not be possible with CSS alone.
- All modern browsers are equipped with JS engines that can execute JS code on the client-side without relying on the back end webserver to update the page.
