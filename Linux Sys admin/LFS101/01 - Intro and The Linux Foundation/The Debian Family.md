The [[Debian]] distribution is upstream for several other distributions, including [[Ubuntu]]. In turn, Ubuntu is upstream for [[Linux Mint]] and a number of other distributions. It is commonly used on both servers and desktop computers. Debian is a **pure open source community project (not owned by any corporation)** and has a strong focus on stability.

Debian provides by far the largest and most complete software repository to its users of any Linux distribution.

Ubuntu aims at providing a good compromise between long term stability and ease of use.
