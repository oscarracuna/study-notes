# Welcome!
Hey, welcome to my notes!
I will be documenting my homelab stuff, university notes and courses/certs (sometimes in an opinionated way).

----
## Goals
- [ ] Move up to System Administrator. Linux sysadmin if we get lucky.
- [ ] Be ready to pass Red Hat Certified System Administrator.

## Currently working on:
- LFS101 Notes. 
- Uni notes - Discrete Math.
- New Windows homelab and Microsoft 365 Fundamentals cert. (Work)

## Side projects:
- [ ] Improve old Discord bot written in Python and the functionality of playing music. Host it in the homelab. 
- [ ] Deploy Quartz Obsidian notes at Work. (Obsidian notes already under testing - HUGE)
- [x] Deploy new Unifi router/fw for the homelab.
- [x] Buy one SATA SSD and one NVME for the 2nd Dell Micro and set up a cluster.
