# Overview
Linux is an open source computer operating system ([[OS]]), initially developed on and for Intel x86-based personal computers. It has been subsequently ported to an astoundingly long list of other hardware platforms, from tiny embedded appliances to the world's largest supercomputers.

# History
In 1991, Linus Torvalds started a project: writing his own **operating system [[kernel]].**

In 1992, Linux was re-licensed using the General Public License ([[GPL]]) by [[GNU]] which enabled it to build a worldwide community of developers. By combining the kernel with other system components from the GNU project, numerous other developers created complete systems called [[Linux Distributions]], **which first appeared in the mid-90s**.

The Linux distributions created in the mid-90s provided the basis for fully free computing and became a driving force in the open source software movement. In 1998, major companies like IBM and Oracle announced their support for the Linux platform and began major development efforts as well.

Today, Linux powers more than half of the servers on the internet, the majority of smartphones, more than 90% of the public cloud workload, and all of the world's most powerful supercomputers.
