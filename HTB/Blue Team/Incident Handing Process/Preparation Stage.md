In the [[Preparation Stage]] we have two separate objectives. The first one is the establishment of incident handling capability within the organization. The second is the ability to protect against and prevent IT security incidents by implementing appropriate protective measures (securing endpoint and server hardening, active directory tiering, [[MFA]], privileged access management, etc.).

## Preparation Prerequisites
During the preparation we need to ensure that we have:
- Skilled incident handling team members.
- Trained workforce.
- Clear policies and documentation.
- Tools.

## Clear Policies & Documentation
Some of the written policies and documentation should contain an up-to-date version of the following information:
- Contact information and roles of the incident handling team members.
- Contact information for the legal and compliance department, management team, IT support, communications and media relations department, law enforcement, ISP, facility management, and external incident response team.
- Incident response policy, plan, and procedures.
- Incident information sharing policy and procedures.
- Baselines of systems and networks, out of a golden image and a clean state environment.
- Network diagrams.
- Organization-wide asset management database.
- User accounts with excessive privileges that can be used on-demand by the team when necessary. These user accounts are normally enabled when an incident is confirmed during the initial investigation and then disabled once it is over. A mandatory password reset is also performed when disabling the users.
- Ability to acquire hardware, software, or an external resource without a complete procurement process.
- Forensic/Investigative cheat sheets.
