The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system. A full Linux Distribution consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations. Each of these tools provides a part of the complete system. Each tool is often its own separate project, with its own developers working to perfect that piece of the system.

Linux distros may be based on different kernel versions. For example, RHEL 8 is based on the 4.18 kernel, which is not new but extremely stable, while RHEL 9 is based on 5.14 kernel.

# Services Associated with Distributions
The vast majority of Linux distros are designed to cater to many different audiences and organizations according to their specific needs and tastes. However, large organizations, such as companies and governmental institutions tend to choose the major commercially-supported distributions from Red Hat, SUSE, and Canonical (Ubuntu).
