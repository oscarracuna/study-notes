I was flown to McAllen, TX back in November 2024 to help deploy new switches for our server room. We moved from Cisco to Fortinet. My job there was to help with cabling and manual work whereas the configuration and set up was handled by our network admin. Still, amazing experience. Ah, that's basically where I got this Catalyst 3560. I asked my manager and I was able to take it home.

And then here's my dumb switch:

We now have a 1 gig POE managed Switch plus an dumb 1 gig POE switch thanks to Facebook Marketplace!!!!
Oh, there's also a Cisco AP. Since this AP is not a standalone AP, it will need some tweaking to make it work.
There is no need for an AP at this point, since the Unifi Express has a built in AP. BUT, since turning on a Guest Network in my Unifi Express really throttles down my network speed, I may deploy this Cisco AP as a guest Network sooner rather than later.
