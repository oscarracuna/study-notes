[[Wordpress]] is the most popular open source Content Management System ([[CMS]]), powering nearly one-third of all websites in the world. It's highly customizable as well as [[SEO]] friendly, which makes it popular among companies.
It's customizable and extensible but that also makes it prone to vulnerabilities through third-party themes and plugins. [[WP]] is written in [[PHP]] and usually runs on [[Apache]] with [[MySQL]] as the [[Back end]].

## What is a CMS?
A powerful tool that helps build a website without the need to code everything from scratch. It does most of the heavy lifting on the infrastructure side to focus more on the design and presentation aspects of the website instead of the back end structure. Users can upload media directly from a media library interface instead of interacting with the web server either from a management portal or via [[FTP]] or [[SFTP]].

A CMS is made up 2 key components:
- A Content Management Application ([[CMA]]) - the interface used to add and manage content.
- A Content Delivery Application ([[CDA]]) - the back end that takes the input entered into the CMA and assembles the code into a working, visually appealing website.
