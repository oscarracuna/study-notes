Linux borrows heavily form the well-established family of [[UNIX]] [[OS]]'.
It was written to be a free and open source alternative; at the time, UNIX was designed for computers much more powerful than PCs, and furthermore, it was quite expensive.

Files are stored in a hierarchical file system, with the top node of the system being the **root or simply "/"**. Whenever possible, Linux makes components available via files or objects that look like files. Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects and can often be worked with using the same utilities used for regular files.

Linux was inspired by UNIX, but **it is not UNIX.**
