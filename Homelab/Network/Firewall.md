>Update: There was a power surge that killed my USG's PSU. A Unifi Express (WiFi6) is already on the way, though. Dec 2025.

Running on an [[Proxmox]] [[LXC]] container.

Selfhosting the Unifi controller won't be needed once the new Unifi Express is deployed. Cool!

I still have my USG around, since the equipment is still good and I just need to buy a new power supply. (Probably going to deploy it a my mom's house and set a site-to-site VPN hehe)

As for the other equipment, I got all of those Cisco devices for close to 30usd off of Facebook Marketplace. Sensational.
