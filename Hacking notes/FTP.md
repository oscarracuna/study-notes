[[File Transfer Protocol]]
To ftp you can do
```
ftp username@ip
```

```
To download something you can use
mget filename
```

When anonymous login is enabled you can connect using ''anonymous'' as username.
You can upload stuff from the folder where you logged in. e.g I logged in from /Desktop so I can only upload files that are on /Desktop.
Also, upon logging in you will have to cd to ftp.
