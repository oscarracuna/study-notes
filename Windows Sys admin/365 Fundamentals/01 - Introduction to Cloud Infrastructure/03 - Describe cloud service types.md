# Describe Infrastructure as a Service
Iaas -> Infrastructure as a Service.
You're basically renting the server and that's about it. You're responsible for setting it up and maintaining it.

Shared responsibility model table (again)

# Describe Platform as a Service
Basically, middle ground between renting rack space in a datacenter (Infra as a Service) and paying for a complete deployed solution (Software as a Service).
The cloud provider takes care of the infra, physical security, internet connection, OS and business intelligence services.

I can't think of a relatable scenario for this one and the ones Microsoft provided on this course don't really sound familiar to me. Skipping them for now.

### Describe Software as a Service
You're renting a full app at this point.
It's the least flexible but the more convenient.

Here's the table one more time hehe

As for scenarios, imagine almost any app. Gmail, Office Suite, Spotify, etc.
