Usually, user input validation takes places in the back end, but sometimes that's not the case and whatever is inputted is processed and rendered on the front end.

- Retrieving previously submitted code - like a user's comment from the back end [[database]]
- Directly displaying unfiltered user input through [[JavaScript]] on the front end.

[[Defacing]] may be an example of HTML injection.
