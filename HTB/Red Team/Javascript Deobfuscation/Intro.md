Code deobfuscation is an important skill to learn if we want to be skilled in code analysis and reverse engineering. 
In this module we start by learning the general structure of an HTML page and then will locate [[JavaScript]] code within it. Once we do that, we will learn what obfuscation is, how it is done, and where it is used and follow that by learning how to deobfuscate such code.
