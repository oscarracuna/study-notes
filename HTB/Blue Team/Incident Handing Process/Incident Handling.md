## Incident Handling Definition & Scope
[[Incident Handling]] ([[IH]]) has become an important part of an organization's defensive capability against cybercrime. 

An [[event]] is an action occurring in a system or network.
- A user sending an email.
- A mouse click.
- A firewall allowing a connection request.

An [[incident]] is an event with a negative consequence. For example, a system crash or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Data theft.
- Fund theft.
- Unauthorized access to data.
- Installation and usage of malware and remote access tools.

[[Incident Handling]] is a clearly defined set of procedures to manage and respond to security incidents in a computer or network environment.

Incident handlers spend most of their time in the first two stages, **preparation** and **detection & analysis**. When a malicious event is detected, we then move on the next stage and respond to the event.

So, incident handling has two main activities, which are **investigating** and **recovering**. The investigation aims to:
- Discover the initial 'patient zero' victim and create an incident timeline.
- Determine what tools and malware the adversary used.
- Document the compromised systems and what the adversary has done.

Following the investigation, the recovery activity involves creating and implementing a recovery plan. When the plan is implemented, the business should resume normal business operations if the incident caused any disruptions.
