I had two interviews for an L2/L3 Linux Systems Engineer and L2 Production Support Analyst.
I think these L1, L2, L3 things are kind of broad. Somewhat like in cars how people can't agree what Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 really are or what that means. LOL

Anyway... Key points to take away from these 1st phase interviews:

- Speak slowly and confidently.
- I think almost always these interviews are done by HR people, so try to use technical lingo but always use examples or hypothetical situations.
- Don't be humble. It's an interview; talk about what you've done, what you like, what you've accomplished and do it with enthusiasm. 
- If you don't know something, explicitly say it, but also try to go through your thought process. I think this could be very appreciated by technical people. Not sure about HR people, they probably want to hear a very solid YES or NO. That's just my impression, though.
- If you get 2 or more interviews, schedule the one your excited the most at the end. That way you can have time to get into that *interview mindset* and be less nervous on that special interview day.
### To try on next interviews
- Be at your Linux desktop and ask if you can share your screen while taking the interview so you can be at the command line. Not sure how that can go, but let's try it.

Had another HR interview over the phone. Unfortunately, I was working out when I received the call so I was not able to speak slowly.

- Reschedule if you won't be able to calm down and speak slowly or are in a noisy/distracting environment.
- Don't ramble too much. Take your time to think about your answer.
