# Welcome!
Hey, welcome to my notes!
I will be documenting my homelab stuff, university notes and courses/certs.

## Current goals
- Move up to System Administrator. Linux sysadmin if we get lucky.
- Pass Red Hat Certified System Administrator.
## Currently working on:
- LFS101 Notes.
- Uni notes - Discrete Math.
## Side projects:
- Improve old Discord bot written in Python and the functionality of playing music. Host it in the homelab. 
- Deploy Quartz Obsidian notes at Work. (Obsidian notes already under testing)
