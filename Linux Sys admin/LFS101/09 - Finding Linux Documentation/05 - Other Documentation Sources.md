# Graphical Help Systems

All Linux desktop systems have a graphical help app. These usually have the question mark icon, lifesaver or any other popular icons to symbolize help. You can also launch them from the terminal, of course.

For example:

- GNOME: `gnome-help` or `yelp`
- KDE: `khelpcenter`

# Package Documentation

You can also find documentation directly pulled from the upstream source code / the package management system.

It can be found under `/usr/share/doc`.
