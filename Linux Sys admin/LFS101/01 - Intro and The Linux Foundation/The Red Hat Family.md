[[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] ([[RHEL]]) heads the family that includes [[CentOS]], [[Fedora]], and [[Oracle Linux]].

Fedora has a close relationship with RHEL and contains significantly more software than Red Hat's enterprise version. One reason for this is that a diverse community is involved in building Fedora, with many contributors who do not work for Red Hat. Furthermore, it is used as a testing platform for future RHEL releases.
