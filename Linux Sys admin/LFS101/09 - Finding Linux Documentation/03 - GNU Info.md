# The GNU Info System

This is the GNU project's standard documentation format, which it prefers as an alternative to `man`. It's basically free-form and supports linked subsections.

It's very similar to man, but topics are connected using links. Can be viewed via CLI, GUI or online.

You can find more complete information from `info` than `man`.

# Using info from the Command Line

Typing `info` without arguments displays an index of available topics.
You can view help for a particular topic by typing `info <topic name>`.

# info Page Structure
The topic which you view in an info page is called a **node**. Nodes are sections and subsections. Each node may contain menus and linked subtopics or items.

| **Key** | **Function**                  |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| n       | Go to the next node           |
| p       | Go to the previous node       |
| u       | Move one node up in the index |
