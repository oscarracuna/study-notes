Our job is to prevent threats from exploiting our vulnerabilities.

**[[Threat]]**
	Anything that could cause harm, loss, damage, or compromise to information technology systems.
		- Natural disasters
		- Cyber-attacks
		- Data integrity breaches
		- Disclosure of confidential information

Unfortunately, we cannot have 100% control over all of those. But on the other hand, we do have control over our vulnerabilities.

**[[Vulnerability]]**
	Any weakness in the system design or implementation.
		- Software bugs
		- Misconfigured software
		- Improperly protected network devices
		- Missing security patches
		- Lack of physical security

The risk lies in the **intersection** between **threats** and our **vulnerabilities**.

- Threat + No vulnerability = No Risk
- Vulnerability + No Threat = No Risk
